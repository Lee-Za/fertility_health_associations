#  Examining the Relationship between Fertility Patterns and Midlife Health in Germany 
## (Master Thesis, Sociology)

Can a certain pattern of having children or remaining childless have direct impacts on physical and mental health of women and men in midlife? Is there something like an ideal ‘fertility behaviour’ that is generally advisable for women and men when it comes to health outcomes in Germany?

Data:   Pairfam Wave 7 (2014/15), the data unfortunately is not open source

Method: Multiple Linear Regression, using Stata

### Research Questions & Hypothesis

Q1: Are parents generally healthier than the childless?

H1: I expect parents, and especially fathers, to generally show slightly better physical
and mental health outcomes than their childless counterparts.


Q2: Do early first birth parents generally suffer from worse health?

H2: Early first birth parents (here up to 22 years) should generally have worse physical and mental health outcomes compared to other parents, mostly moderated through socio economic factors. The optimum age for first birth should lay around age 30 for women and a few years later for men.


Q3: What is the optimal number of children with regard to health outcomes of the parent?

H3: Among parents, having a single child or more than three children is associated
with worse physical and mental health outcomes than having two to three kids. Having no children should be associated with worst health.
